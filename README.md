This project was made with inspiration from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) to further enhance my HTML, CSS, and Javascript skills.

## Some of the skills worked on during this project ##

* Strong focus on writing **very** clean and organized HTML & CSS.
* Practice with flexbox parent and children relationships.
* Debugging: This calculator had a lot of edge cases that required *a lot* of problem solving in the Chrome debugger.
* Research: I spent a lot of time looking into ways to implement various parts of the calculator, and had to get more comfortable with some methods I'd not used in the past or hadn't used frequently.
    A few examples of these:
    * forEach();
    * isFinite();
    * parseFloat();
    * Number.isInteger();

This was a tougher project with tons of edge cases that required ironing out over the course of a day or two, but overall was enjoyable. I got a lot of practice with syntax I'd not been using as much (arrow functions) and any chance to get uncomfortable is a chance to learn. Major thanks to [Dane Maison](https://github.com/danemaison) for letting me rubber ducky at him various times throughout the project.
